wlglamor is an experimental XWayland glamor DDX.

The ultimate goal is to have only one DDX for Wayland, and this code will
probably be integrated to xf86-video-wayland.

It works with the XWayland branch of Xserver 1.14, unlike the current xf86-video-ati and 
xf86-video-nouveau XWayland branches we can find today.

The DDX is based on Glamor and gbm.
