wlglamor is an experimental XWayland glamor DDX.

The ultimate goal is to have only one DDX for Wayland, and this code will
probably be integrated to xf86-video-wayland.

It works with the XWayland branch of Xserver 1.15.

The DDX is based on Glamor, and provides DRI3 (no DRI2).
It requires the driver (Mesa) to support DRI3,
which at the time of writing is only for intel (but radeon
and nouveau are coming soon).
